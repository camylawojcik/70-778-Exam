### Power BI
Is a collection of services, apps, and connectors that lets you connect to your data, wherever it happens to reside, filter it if necessary, and then bringi it into Power BI to create compelling visualizations that you can share with others.
- Composição:
  - Power BI Desktop
  - Power BI Service (SaaS)
  - Mobile Power BI Apps
- __Building Blocks__:
  - Visualizations
  - Datasets
  - Reports
  - Dashboards
  - Tiles
    - __Visualization__: visual representation of data, like a chart, a color-coded map or other interesting things you can create to represent your data visually. The goal is to present the data in a ay tat provides context and insights.
    - __Datasets__: a collection of data to create its visualizations;
      - Can be a single file or a combination of many different sources
      - Ex: Database + excel file = Single dataset
      - Filtering it before bringing into PBI lets you focus on the data that matters to you.
      - A lot of pre-built __connectors__ included. 
 
    - __Reports__ is a collections of visualizations that appear together on one or more pages. 
      - Collection of items that are related to each other
    - __Dashboards__: When you share a single page from a report, or a collection of visualizations, you create a dashboard. 
      - Collection of visuals from a single page that you can share with others. 
      - Must fit in a single page. (Canvas: white backdrop in Power Bi)
    - __Tiles__: is a single visualization on a report or a dashboard. (é cada um dos visuais).
- __APP__: is a collection of preset, ready-made visuals and reports that are shared woth an entire organization. Ge you up and running quickly, with data and dashboards 
- __Power Bi Desktop__: Is a free application for PCs that lets you gather, tranform, and visualize your data. 
  - Ribbon - Displays common tasks that are associated with reports and visualizations.
  - Report view, or canvas - Where visualizations are created and arranged. You can switch between Report, Data, and Model views by selecting the icons in the left column.
  - Pages tab - Located along the bottom of the page, this area is where you would select or add a report page.
  - Visualizations pane - Where you can change visualizations, customize colors or axes, apply filters, drag fields, and more.
  - Fields pane - Where query elements and filters can be dragged onto the Report view or dragged to the Filters area of the Visualizations pane.
  - If you use any of Excel's advanced BI features like Power Query, Power Pivot, or Power View, you can import that data into Power BI, too.
  
- __Calculated Columns__: one reason for create is to estabilish a relationship between tables when no unique filds exist. 
- __Measure__: Are calculated as you interact with your reports and aren't stored your database.
- __Calculated Table__: Provides intermidiate calculations and data that you want stored as part of the model rather than as part of a query. You can use calculated tables, for example, to cross join two tables. 

- You can ensure that a dashboard will always have a collapsed navigation bar by appending the following to the end of the URL:
  - __?collapseNavigation=true__
- quick insights
- __Workspaces__
  - Classic Workpsaces: groups based onde the office 365 groups
  - New Workspaces: the default workspace in power bi. Assign security groups, distribution lists, Microsoft 365 groups and individuals.
    - Create a workspace in Power Bi without creating office 365 group
    Use more granular workspaces roles for more flexible permissions management in a workspace
    - The Power BI Admin can control who can create workspaces in Power BI. 
  - Relatorios para embed: ficam publicos na internet
- __Gateway__
  - The cloud service creates a query and the encrypted credentials fro the on-premises data source. The query and credentials are sent to the gateway queue for processing;
  - The gateway cloud service analyzes the query and pushes the request to Azre Service Bus
  - Azure Service Bus sends the pending requests to the gateway 
  - The gateway gets the query, decrypts the credentials, and connects to one or more data sources with those credentials;
  - The gateway sends the query to the data source to be run;
  - The results are sent from data source back to the gateway and then to the cloud service. The service uses the results. 
  - Power BI Pro: 8 x por dia (Capacidade compartilhada) 48 x por dia (Premium)
  - As Atualizações automaticas são desativadas após 4 falhas ou após detectar um erro irrecuperável.
  - __Incremental Refresh__
    - Refreshs are faster - only the data that needs to be changed gets refreshed.
    - You no longer need to keep your onnections to long-running data connections open to schedule a refresh.
    - Resource Consumption is reduced 
    - __How It works__
      - Define Filter Parameters: RangeStart and RangeEnd (Home > Manage Parameters | Type Data/Time, Suggested Value: Any Value | Current Value: The date on which you want to begin the import)
      - (Power Query Editor) Go to the applicable column, the ight-click that column and select Custom Filter. 
      - There is one option to Detect data changes and you can select a data/time column used to identify and refresh only the days where the data has changed.
      - There is one option where is possible refresh only complete periods.
- __Endorse your Datasets__
  - Promotion: promote ypur datasets when they're ready for wide-spread usage. Any workspace member with Write permissions can promote your datasets.
  - Certification: Request certification for a promoted dataset from admin user that is defined in the Dataset Certification tenant admin setting. This adds an additional layer of security for your datasets. Crtification can be a highly selective process, on only the truly realiable and authoritative datasets are used accross the organization.
- __Power Bi query caching (Premium or Embedded)__
    - The query results are only specific to a user, and you cand only use query caching on a specific page of a report
    - It's allows for usage dedicated capacity and NOT on the dataset itself
- __Workspaces__
  - Administrador
  - Membro: Faz tudo que o adm faz, mas não pode adicionar/remover usuários
    - Não é possível remover o workspace e nem atualizar os metadados;
  - Colaborador: 
    - Não pode adicionar/remover usuários
    - Não pode publciar, atualizar nem editar um aplicativo em um workspace, a menos que tenha recebido essa capacidade de administradores/membros;
    - Pode criar, atualizar e publicar conteúdo e relatórios em um novo workspace; 
    - Pode agendar atualizações de dados;
  - Visualizador:
    - Não pode adicionar nem remover usuários;
    - Só pode exibir um relatório ou dashboard em um workspace
    - Pode ler dados armazenados em fluxos de dados do workspace;
- Pipeline de Implantação (Pbi Premium)
  - É um recurso que gerencia o conteúdo em dashboards, relatórios e conjuntos de dados entre ambientes diferentes no ciclo de vida de desenvolvimento. Aqui você pode desenvolver e testar o conteúdo do Power Bi em uma localização centralizada e simplificar o processo antes de implantar o conteúdp final para os usuários finais. 
    - Maior produtividade: você pode reutilizar pipelines de implantação;
    - Entrega mais rápida de conteúdo: dev. simplificado
    - Menor Intervenção Humana necessária e menor chance de erro (devido a reutilização)
  - Ambientes: (Você pode decidir quais incluir, conforme sua necessidade)
    - Desenvolvimento
    - Testar
    - Produção
- __Power Bi's Lineage View__ In Lineage View you can quickly refresh datasets and see the relationships betwenn the artifacts in a workspace as well as their external dependencies. 
  - Only accessible to admin, contributor, and member roles. 
  - Possivel notificar os usuários impactados
  - Possível visualizar os reports e o numero de usuários
- __Sensitivity Labels__
  Specify which data can be exported. These labels are configured externally to Power Bi, and Power Bi allows you to quickly and easily use them in your reports and dashboards. These labels allows you to define and protect content, even outside of Power Bi. 
  - None, Personal, General, Confidential and Highly Confidential
